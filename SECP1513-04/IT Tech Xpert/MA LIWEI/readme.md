| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster |Clarity Techworks' presentation focused on its pivotal role in fintech and blockchain within the ICT sector, delving into detailed discussions on industry advancements, company mission and vision, essential ICT roles, and skill requirements. The talk examined technological evolution from a historical perspective, emphasizing the company's prominent position as a key player in the industry. Simultaneously, it underscored their dedication to talent development and continuous learning while exploring prevailing industry trends and challenges. This comprehensive overview provided attendees with an insightful glimpse into the ever-evolving digital technology landscape. | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video |We were both excited and rewarded by UTM DIGITAL's industrial visit. The visit provided us with valuable insights into the extensive work involved in delivering and maintaining digital services for UTM, the necessary steps to enhance the system, and the significance of knowledge acquired in the SECP 1513 (Technology and Information Systems) course. Lectures also bridge theoretical knowledge from the classroom to real-world applications. We strongly believe that more such activities in the future will significantly enrich our learning experience.                                     https://youtu.be/LJbhXOpG3gg| 
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report |We were both excited and rewarded by UTM DIGITAL's industrial visit. The visit provided us with insights into the amount of work involved in providing and maintaining digital services for UTM, the necessary steps to improve the system, and the importance of the knowledge learned in the SECP 1513 (Technology and Information Systems) course. Lectures also connect theoretical knowledge from the classroom to real-world applications. We believe that more activities like this in the future will greatly enrich our learning experience.  | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter |During my tour, Clarity Techworks showcased its diverse departments, including the Web application development team, user interface and user experience (UI/UX) design team, application Programming interface (API) development team, Android application development team, iOS application development team, and quality assurance (QA) analyst team. This experience not only provided me with a deep understanding of the technical aspects of the information and communication technology (ICT) field but also equipped me with numerous valuable soft skills. Through interactions with these teams, I gained a profound appreciation for the power of teamwork: while individual abilities may be limited, collaborative efforts can yield outstanding results with higher efficiency and effectiveness. Mr Yee, Chief Technology Officer, gave us a detailed overview of how the company operates and how he successfully led projects. The experiences and advice he shared were extremely valuable. One suggestion that left a lasting impression on me was to prioritize accumulating work experience early on. Mr Yee emphasized that although money may bring short-term satisfaction, rich work experience can lead to significant career advancements and improve our overall quality of life in the long run.
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble |In the PC assembly process, I not only learned how to precisely arrange each hardware component inside the case to ensure they are in order but also mastered efficient cable management skills to maintain a clean machine and optimize heat efficiency. Additionally, I gained insight into the inner workings of a PC, understanding the specific roles of key components such as CPU, memory, hard disk, and cooling fan and how they collaborate to provide optimal computing performance. Through hands-on steps of assembly and disassembly - starting with easily opening the case cover, carefully disconnecting various cables, and removing components like power supply, memory, hard drive, and CPU fan one by one - each step deepened my understanding of computer construction and functionality. This entire process not only impressed me with the exquisite design of PCs but more importantly inspired me to explore information technology further and strengthened my determination to pursue a career in IT.|
| 6 | Design Thinking | This project has made me deeply realize the indispensability of teamwork. Throughout the project, the power of teamwork was highlighted at every step, from initial brainstorming to co-writing a comprehensive report and crafting an innovative prototype. Without the joint efforts and respective expertise of my team members, completing such a complex task would have been nearly impossible. Additionally, I carefully think and solve problems through logical reasoning every time I make a decision. This process not only trains my thinking skills but also allows me to learn the key steps of design thinking - from conceiving and creating effective prototypes to systematically designing or optimizing an application; each step enhances our ability to innovate and implement technology.
